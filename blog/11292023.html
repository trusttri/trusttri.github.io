                        I've been feeling pretty burned out. But, one piece of good news amid the bad ones -- I shared my writing with a faculty member whose writing I deeply admire. They responded without any critique, so I asked if they had any feedback. They said they didn't have any to give!

                        At first, I wondered if they were not interested in my work. But, I realized that would not make any sense, considering their existing level of engagement. I concluded they genuinely meant it in a good way. Their words made my day, especially given the recent series of incidents.

                        (I hope this faculty member doesn't recognize that I'm writing about them.üò≥ I might actually delete this post later.)
