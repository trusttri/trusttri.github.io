                    	Some very quickly written thoughts about thinking too much...

                        I'm hesitant to upload this, but it feels like I've been living in my head a lot these days. That's probably not news, though, but what's new is that I've reflected on more about how I feel about it. I actually think living in one's head is not always bad -- I can sense it has been helpful for research. But, it's also true I could've used my time better, instead of... just thinking and daydreaming. And, it can be immensely exhausting. Like many things, finding the right balance is art.
                        <br>
                        <br>
						The good news is that compared to years ago, I can sense better when my thoughts start to drown me. I wonder if PhDing helped -- after all, finishing a PhD requires a ton of metacognition. Compared to before I started the PhD, and last year, even, I can understand myself much better. In very nuanced ways, I can more clearly see what I'm thinking and feeling, and tell myself, "Oh, so that's where you were heading towards. Time to stop here, Jane."
						<br>
                        <br>
						Still, I wish I could immaculately master the skill of knowing what and how to think at a given time. I wonder if finding a "proper" hobby will help. The goal would be to periodically and intensely focus on something other than my own thoughts that are eating at me. To be clear, I (think) know what to do to truly relax and let go of negative energy -- journaling, hanging out with people I deeply trust, listening to music, running, reading, etc. But, when I journal, I mostly write about my thoughts, which would require me to reflect on them. And, there will be moments when I want, or need, to calm myself down, instead of spending time with others. The only problem with listening to music is that I can go on forever (and be in a daydream mode). Running helps me live in the present, but I want something more artistic. Reading is soothing, but I want something more active.

						<br>
						At this point, I wonder if it's just me wanting something different, ha ha ha! :] I've been telling myself I need a new hobby since last year, and the good news is that <a href="01032024.html">I did start reading more books</a>. But, I have a nagging feeling I should try to do something more... active? Not too academic? Hmm. There have been a couple of candidates, but no success so far. I've been daydreaming about starting a hobby instead of actually doing it. This is also not new to my family and friends, probably.
