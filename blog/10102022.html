                    If a junior PhD student asks me to recommend a piece of writing on how to do great research, I would recommend this one: <a href="https://michaelnielsen.org/blog/principles-of-effective-research/">Principles of Effective Research by Dr. Michael Nielsen</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So many gems! I had a lot of thoughts after reading it, but today, I wanted to write about working on big and important research problems versus small and "okay" ones. This is a post written by whim, by the way, so excuse any typos (and I might revise it later).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Recently, a few junior PhD students asked me for tips about publishing papers, and I *think* I tried to offer similar advice that Dr. Nielsen wrote. Working on impactful and important problems in a way so that you develop your unique research taste and skills should be the highest priority. But at the same time, it's likely you should work on smaller, less but reasonably important, problems along the way. Especially if you feel like you're stuck.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, (probably) sometime between fall 2020 and fall 2021, I remember telling myself the opposite. Not so sure what others around me thought, but I think I *tried and aspired* to focus on researching impactful, important, and difficult problems. I'm emphasizing I tried üòÖ, because I wasn't free from the mindset of counting the number of papers I published. I had cycles of looking at my CV and thinking "Hmm should I write more papers" and then scolded myself for thinking that way. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are mainly two reasons I kind of changed my mind. I say "kind of changed" because I still think it's unhealthy to write more papers for the sake of having a longer CV. So what changed? I think it's fine, and sometimes even necessary, to work on smaller papers as long as you haven't lost focus on finding important and interesting problems to work on next. First, you sometimes don't know what those problems are. That is, you probably have some thoughts on what they can be, but you could be wrong. I have been wrong, but that is for another post (to be exact, I still think the research direction I had in mind is important, but it is not the most immediately important one, at least from my viewpoint). What I realized is that it's critical to keep an open mind, and working on smaller problems can be helpful in discovering a compelling research direction. Second, working on smaller papers can be a useful way to develop a new set of skills. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That said, I firmly think researchers should prioritize long-term vision and impactful and important research. So my advice to a younger me would be that it's fine to work on smaller papers, as long as you are striving to develop your unique research taste and looking out for important problems. If you don't need to work on any small papers during your academic career, great for you. Maybe my thoughts will change in the future, but I'm very tired of the publish-and-perish culture. Academia needs to change.
