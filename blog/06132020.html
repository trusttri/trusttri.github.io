            I'm currently at Ann Arbor, trying to take care of myself and others close to me during these hectic times (although I really want to visit Korea...) While it's rough for everyone these days (including me), I think it has been personally a good year academic-wise. 
            <br>I guess I'm most proud that I grew. I became better at writing (which my advisor also told me and that compliment meant a lot to me personally) and I've learned how to collaborate better with my advisor and others. I'm actually prouder of this growth than having accepted papers (CHI 2020, WebSci 2020). 
                <br>
              That said, I've been thinking about the meaning of research (and doing a PhD) a lot these days with the "world burning down". I really realized I need to study more about race. 
                <br>
                <br>
            Recently I started my internship with Jill Dimond which I'm excited about. It was a bit crushing that Airbnb deferred the internship due to the pandemic, but I'm really happy another awesome opportunity came. :) Other than the internship, this summer I definitely want to read more books. Thinking of updating a reading list in this website to hold myself more accountable.
            I've read some chapters of "Design Justice" by Sasha Costanza-Chock, but haven't yet finished the entire book. I also started reading "Designing an Internet" by David D. Clark.
