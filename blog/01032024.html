                        If you read other posts of mine from last year, you might have had a slight impression that 2023 was not the best year for me.

                        But, I'd be lying if I said it was filled with nothing but pain. One thing I'm very grateful for is that I fell in love with books again. I was a voracious reader until middle school-ish, I think. I probably read a bit more than an "average undergraduate student", but at the time, I was looking more for hands-on experience. For example, I was trying to stay afloat while studying computer science as a business school student. Funnily enough, I joined a well-known book club, but I made all sorts of excuses to not show up. (Joining it required an interview process -- I shouldn't have applied so that someone else could've used the opportunity better than me.) Just like that, I drifted away from the book nerd I was.

                        Even after entering the PhD program, there were two modes: 1) frantically reading when I had to -- for example, finishing course assignments, and 2) reading deeply when I was mesmerized or curious about someone's research. I didn't read much outside of these two contexts. Even for 2), I hadn't returned to the old me. I remember a faculty member giving me an amused look when I blurted out that I didn't really enjoy reading. (My inner reaction to their facial expression -- please tell me it's not a crime to not read much as an academic!) Of course, I'm not 100% sure if I read less than other academics -- but that was the impression I got. At the same time, I think I always had a twinge of guilt that I lost the old book lover inside me. But, finally in 2023, I found myself wanting to read books because it gave me solace. In particular, three books gave me epiphanies when I felt overwhelming confusion or/and pain. (I'd love to share them at some point, but also feel a bit shy.)

                        Why the sudden change? The reason is nothing mysterious. But, explaining it while not losing the nuances requires a longer post. 
                        For now, I'm writing this to encourage myself to keep reading in 2024 -- especially for my inner peace and <a href="https://geekheresy.org/">intrinsic growth</a>.
