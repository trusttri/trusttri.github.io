                        <b>Knowing what you desire</b> is fundamental to every aspect of your life. I know, it sounds very corny, but I've been thinking about this a lot.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Based on my observation, some people do not realize that they have a certain kind of desire that they cannot (yet) fulfill. And, that is dangerous. It causes a person to become reckless to satisfy their desire, and sometimes, they end up harming others in the process. 
                        I should be clear that I know this (or something similar) happens to everyone at some point in one's life. But, some people are more diligent than others at critically reflecting on their behaviors. A very basic example -- let's say you have a desire to have your name known within your research community. But, your research taste and skills are not quite there yet. A person who recognizes this and is good at self-reflection would work insanely hard. A person who doesn't will continuously try all sorts of sneaky ways for satiation. (It's a <i>separate</i> question of whether this desire is a good one. I don't think so, but it's probably a desire that a lot of researchers have had, to some degree.)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This also applies to all relationships. Let's say you meet an interesting person -- you realize you are fascinated by them. When this happens to me, I ask myself "Why do I want to talk to them so much?" Usually, the answer reveals something about my desire. Perhaps that person has some kind of wisdom that I aspire to have, the person is a good listener who understands that I want to be heard, etc. My conclusion is that understanding this desire helps you to have a sustainable relationship with the person. For example, you want to be friends with someone, but your underlying desire is something that would not benefit them. Or, maybe they have limited bandwidth to help you fulfill it. Then, it's best that you suppress your desire to avoid violating their boundaries. Of course, there is <i>much more</i> to maintaining a relationship than understanding your (and the other person's) desire, but it is something I'd argue people should be thinking more about.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So, I've been trying to ask myself -- what do I desire? Is it a healthy desire? If it's not, how can I transform and leverage it in a healthy way?
