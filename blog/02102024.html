                        <b>Knowing what you desire</b> is fundamental to every aspect of your life. I know, it sounds very corny, but I've been thinking about this a lot.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Based on my observation, some people do not realize that they have a certain kind of desire that they cannot (yet) fulfill. And, that is dangerous. It causes a person to become reckless to meet their desire without realizing it, and sometimes, they end up harming others. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I should be clear that I know this happens to everyone at some point in their life (including me). But, some people are more diligent than others at reflecting on their behaviors and ensuring that it doesn't happen again. A very basic example -- let's say you have a desire to have your name known within your research community. But, your research taste and skills are not there yet. A person who recognizes this and is good at self-reflection would work insanely hard. A person who doesn't will try all sorts of sneaky ways to satisfy themself. (It's a separate question of whether this desire is a good one. I don't think so, but it's probably a desire that a lot of researchers have had, to some degree.)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This also applies to all relationships. Let's say you meet an interesting person -- you realize you are infatuated with them for some reason, either romantically or non-romantically. When this happens to me, I ask myself "Why do I want to talk to them so much?" Usually, the answer reveals something about my desire. Perhaps that person has some kind of wisdom that I aspire to have, the person is a good listener who can fulfill my desire of wanting to be heard, etc. My conclusion is that understanding this desire helps you to have a sustainable relationship with the person. For example, you want to be friends with a person, but your underlying desire is something that they have limited bandwidth to help you out with. Then, it's best that you suppress your desire to avoid violating their boundaries.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So, I've been trying to ask myself more -- what do I desire? Is it a healthy desire? If it's not, how can I transform and leverage it in a healthy way?
