                        Hi! I am currently an undergraduate in <a href="https://korea.ac.kr/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do">Korea University</a>,
                        double majoring <a href="http://biz1.korea.ac.kr/en">Business</a> and <a href="">Computer Science</a>.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I have studied and engaged in three research projects in <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu">MIT EECS (course 6)</a> by applying through undergraduate special student program from fall 2016 to spring 2017.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Due to my interdisciplinary background of studying Computer Science and Business together, I found it natural for me to feel passion in research that uses computation while also considering the social context.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                         Currently I am applying for graduate schools, wanting to study more about human-computer interaction and related systems.
                    </p>

                        <h4 class="card-title project-title">Why Computer Science? Why HCI research?</h4>
                        Although I started off as a Business major, I always had the thirst for creation using technology. I looked at the programmers more in awe
                        instead of the project managers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This led me to learn programming and engage in the Big Data Analytics Competition organized by SK Telecom, the largest telecommunications corporation in South Korea. The goal of the competition was to design a business plan from analyzing big data. This was the first time I studied data mining, and for three months we taught ourselves how to preprocess data, select the right algorithms, and analyze the results while sharing our insights with each other. It was an eye-opening experience, and I loved the freedom of being able to create using technology.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Simultaneously, however, the experience made it evident I preferred projects with a more novel and fundamental approach to the mere application of business strategies. The understanding that research involves finding novel approaches fueled my desire to immerse myself more deeply in research endeavors.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At the same time, I fully knew that I was interested in the interaction between the computer and the human,
                        attributing to a user-centered mindset I gained from Business classes.
                        This led me to decide to involve in more human-centric research projects while at MIT, and through these research experiences I narrowed down my interests within the area of HCI.
