                        <strong>Update will be soon added!</strong>

                        <br>
                        This project is still ongoing, so I will briefly introduce my motivation, contribution, and things I learned so far from this project.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Motivation </h4>
                    <p>
                        Experiencing millions of people protesting against the political corruption in South Korea (2016 - 2017) and witnessing it lead to the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Park_Geun-hye">impeachment of the previous president</a>
                        was the main motivation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was surprising to me that the experts evaluated the social media playing a critical role in assisting the citizens to gather their opinions and organize peaceful candlelight protests.
                        I have always thought it is hard to establish consensus in the SNS, mainly because I experienced it is very hard to resolve disputes regarding
                        controversial matters including sex, gender, and politics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to study more about systems that can build consensus on a large scale, further aiding collective action, and asked for voluntary research opportunities
                        in <a href="http://haystack.csail.mit.edu">Haystack Group at MIT</a>.

                        <p>
                            My main contributions to this project were the following:
                            <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                                (1) create a novel dataset of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment">Requests for Comment (RfC)</a>
                                <br>
                                (2) analyze the dataset to earn insights about the RfC process using various techniques including machine learning and correlation
                                <br>
                                (3) participate in interviewing top RfC participants extracted from the dataset to find issues within the system
                                <br>
                                (4) design and implement new features in Wikum to resolve existing issues and improve the process

                            I found it interesting to:

                             <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                                 (1) earn insights about online discussions by utilizing data

                                 (2) design and develop systems to improve collaborative work

                            Through this project I mostly learned how to:

                                <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                                    (1) efficiently create a (large) dataset from the web
                                    <br>
                                    (2) freely use various analytical techniques including machine learning
                                    <br>
                                    (3) develop systems using web framework and related software (Django, RabbitMQ, Celery) - I fell in love with Django.

                         <h4> Where from here? </h4>
                         <p>
                            I began to have interest in resolving disputes and bridging opposing views online.
                             <br>
                             More generally, I decided I want to study more about <b>social computing</b> including <b>online discussion</b>
                             and <b>collaboration</b>.
                             <br>
                             I am also eager to study new areas such as <b>crowdsourcing</b>, since I am aware of the importance of
                             building new systems using human computation.
