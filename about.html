                        Hi! I'm Jane Im. I am a fifth year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan  <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">School of Information</a> and <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/">Computer Science & Engineering</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.nikolabanovic.net/">Dr. Nikola Banovic</a> (CSE advisor) and <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Dr. Florian Schaub</a> (SI advisor). I was told that I <i>may</i> be the first PhD student to be formally evaluated by SI and CSE PhD program committees and enrolled in the two programs via <a href="https://rackham.umich.edu/navigating-your-degree/student-initiated-doctoral-program/">SIDP</a>. I helped CSE faculty in designing the first proposal for evaluating students who want to walk the same path. I find great benefits to be in both programs, so please feel free to reach out if you want to do the same!

                        <br>
                        Before coming to Michigan, I finished my undergraduate studies in  <a href="https://korea.ac.kr/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do">Korea University</a>,
                        majoring in <a href="http://biz1.korea.ac.kr/en">Business</a> and <a href="">Computer Science</a>.
                        I'm guessing this background made me more open to interdisciplinary research. That is, I identify Human-Computer Interaction as the closest research community, but I try to not let that limit my interests.

                        In my free time, I daydream about learning how to write lyrics. I want to write a song someday. :)

                        <p>
                        Ever since I went to school, I've received a lot of questions about my name because it's not a common Korean name. When I came to the U.S., I noticed a lot of people tend to ask if "Jane" is my "real name." Long story short, it's both my Korean and English name. My parents thought 제인 (Jane) is a good name for both Korean and English names. "제인" is how you would write the English name "Jane" in Korean. For example, "Jane Austin" is translated into "제인 오스틴" in Korean (Jane -> 제인, Austin -> 오스틴). The pronounciation of "제" roughly matches to "Ja" and "인" roughly matches to "ne."
