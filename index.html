                        I research the definition of consent to design safer social computing systems (e.g., social media, workplace software), and study relevant socio-economic factors to rethink platform companies’ business practices. Existing social computing systems enable two broad classes of problem: 1) interpersonal harm users cause one another (e.g., online harassment) and 2) institutional abuse and exploitation of users (e.g., companies’  surveillance of users). Both types of issues are closely related with people’s consent decisions (e.g., user-to-user: "Do I decide to interact with this person on social media?"; user-to-company: "Do I opt in to platforms’ tracking for targeted ads?"). However, despite its relevance to socio-technical problems, the concept of consent has not been fully expored to design more fine-grained safety tools, nor has it resulted in informed privacy choices (e.g., overwhelming consent popups). In my research, I rethink the definition of consent by drawing from feminist and Human-Computer Interaction literature to <a href="https://consentful.systems/">reimagine social software that people can use with enthusiastic consent</a>. Specifically, I develop safety or privacy tools and governance mechanisms, and conduct experiments or field studies to study their impact on people.

                      <!--   Affirmative consent is the idea that someone must ask for, and earn, enthusiastic approval before interacting with someone else. In this paper, we introduce the five principles of affirmative consent: affirmative consent is voluntary, informed, specific, revertible, and unburdensome. We show how these principles can 1) theoretically explain a wide range of problematic phenomena in social platforms (e.g., online harassment, revenge porn) and 2) generate new design ideas for consentful socio-technical systems.
