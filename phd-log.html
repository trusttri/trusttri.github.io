            Below is a list of recent updates, which admittedly focuses on the good news. I think it's important to share bad news as well, to normalize rejections and failures; While it's imperfect, you can glimpse more of my honest thoughts on the <a href="blog/blog_main.html">Thoughts</a> page. Also, if you're a student who wants to discuss struggles in academia, please don't hesitate to reach out.

                        10/09/2022: Some updates on the past seven months. Remotely worked in South Korea for about 2.5 months (felt great to spend time with family ‚ù§Ô∏è), received Special Recognition for Outstanding Review for UIST 2022 (I always thought I wasn't good at reviewing, so I guess I improved!), assisted on a CSCW 2023 paper led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lia-bozarth-697266140/">Lia Bozarth</a> (under minor revision right now). I also worked on and submitted a paper to CHI 2023 and while it was a super memorable experience, I got very burned out and took a vacation. Also attended Trust and Safety Research Conference to <a href="https://www.tsresearchconference.org/events/happy-hour-and-poster-session">present a poster</a> (got useful feedback on what will hopefully be my dissertation, and more importantly, I was able to reconnect with old friends living in the area üòä).</li>
